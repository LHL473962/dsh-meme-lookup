/**
 * Approval store — the UI-side answerer half of the DSH approval seam
 * (`ctx.approval`). The harness's permission layer asks
 * `ApprovalService.request()`, which dispatches an `approval/request`
 * waterfall; the listener registered in plugin.ts parks the request here,
 * surfaces one ask at a time to the TUI permission prompt, and settles the
 * harness promise when the user decides, the
 * asker's abort signal fires, or the plugin tears down.
 *
 * Queue semantics mirror QuestionStore: parallel tool calls can trigger
 * several asks before any answer is given, so asks are drained FIFO.
 * Outcomes are the protocol's closed set — `'allowed-once'` and
 * `'rejected'` from the panel, `'cancelled'` on abort/teardown; there is
 * no allow-always or feedback channel in the protocol.
 *
 * The store presents its asks through the shared permission-panel shape
 * (`src/channel/permissions.ts`), so the one approval panel renders DSH and
 * backend prompts alike: a DSH ask offers exactly the protocol's two
 * options (allow once / reject), and the DSH-only facts (the `external`
 * source badge, the background-session id) ride along on the snapshot.
